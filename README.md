# Machine Learning Portfolio – Adina Mazova

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and data analysis projects completed as part of academic coursework. Each notebook explores a different method or algorithm, using real or synthetic datasets.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 🧪 1. Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering
- Techniques: PCA, DBSCAN, KMeans
- Goal: Reduce feature space and cluster tuberculosis case data
- Outcome: Visualized and interpreted regional health patterns

### 🌙 2. Decision Tree Optimization
- Dataset: Noisy `make_moons`
- Tools: GridSearchCV, DecisionTreeClassifier
- Outcome: Tuned tree depth to maximize model accuracy

### 📏 3. Statistical Distribution of Heights
- Tool: NumPy, matplotlib
- Goal: Analyze central tendency and variation in height data
- Outcome: Generated histograms, means, and distribution curves

### 🔍 4. t-SNE + DBSCAN
- Techniques: t-SNE for dimensionality reduction + DBSCAN clustering
- Application: High-dimensional synthetic data

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn
- pandas / NumPy

## 📎 How to Use

Each project is a separate `.ipynb` file. Open in Jupyter or Colab to explore.
